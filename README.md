  // Add logic to filter by hire date if available
  const threeMonthsAgo = new Date();
  threeMonthsAgo.setMonth(threeMonthsAgo.getMonth() - 3);
  
  // Return filtered employees based on your criteria
  return employees.filter(emp => {
    // Add your filtering logic here
    return true; // Currently returns all employees
  });
}
```

Modify `flashcards.css` to customize the appearance:

- Animations: Add or modify transition effects
